        <h2>Services we offer</h2>
        <p class="lead">The fastest way to describe our business structure & operations is as the “Uber of internet
          broadband providers” we have developed a platform and business structure that allows us to successfully
          outsource the bulk of our operations and services at a substantial reduction to overall operational cost.</p>
        <p>
          Only 3 million out of 17.5 million households in south Africa currently have internet
          fibre and it is expected that the number will continue by half a million households on a yearly basis
          since
          all network providers in the country migrate their infrastructure from traditional ADSL copper wires to
          fibre
          optic infrastructure which is why RefrMe has entered partnership with the major fibre network providers
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We outsource our technical and support contracts to qualified technicians to install broadband internet
            to our customers on a self-employed independent business owner model.
          </li>
          <li>We outsource our customer service to talented work at home agents, our agents are under our
            independent business owner model. Agents are recruited based on experience and are given training on
            utilizing our platform and the technologies that we have created to generate an income. Our agents
            dictate their own working hours and receive training in entrepreneurship and how to run their own
            business.
          </li>
