                  <h2>How It Works</h2>
                  RefrMe is a Referral based marketing platform that is designed to democratise industries in south
                  Africa that have had a history of being multinational conglomerates and monopolies. We believe that
                  only through radical transformation of traditional business models will we change the status-quo, get
                  better prices and service delivery in South Africa. Our business is the perfect answer to problems
                  specific to south Africa such as poor service delivery, high unemployment and unsustainable
                  inequality.

                  <h2>How You Earn</h2>
                  How you make money is simple. Our Referral-Based-Marketing platform pays you a percentage in annuity
                  for every successful referral you make of our services or service of our affiliate partners. You can
                  currently earn a passive income by just referring our world class reliable internet services. Everyone
